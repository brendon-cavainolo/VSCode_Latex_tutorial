abstract = {In the present study, theoretical model for the transient response of a capillary flow under the combined effects of electroosmotic and capillary forces at low Reynolds number is presented. The governing equation is derived based on the balance among the electrokinetic, surface, viscous and gravity forces. A non-dimensional transient governing equation for the penetration depth as a function of time is obtained by normalizing the viscous, gravity and electroosmotic forces with surface tension force. A new non-dimensional group for the electroosmotic force, Eo, is obtained through the non-dimensional analysis. This new non-dimensional group is a representation of combined electroosmosis and surface tension, i.e., capillarity. The numerical solution of governing equation is obtained to study the effect of different operating parameters on the flow front transport. In a combined flow, it is observed that the flow with positive and low negative magnitude Eo numbers, the attainment of equilibrium penetration depth is similar to a capillary flow. In case of high negative magnitude Eo numbers, complete filling of the channel is observed. The electrolyte with lower permittivity delays the progress of the flow front whereas a large EDL transports the electrolyte quickly. Higher viscous and gravity forces also delay the transport process in the combined flow. This model suggests that in combined flow the electrokinetic parameters also play an important role on the capillary flow and experiments are required to confirm this electrokinetic effect on capillary transport.}

abstract = {The present study reports a theoretical investigation of capillary transport of microbead suspension in microfluidic channels with finite size reservoirs at the inlet. The reservoir–microchannel combination is often the case in Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) where biomolecules are transported using capillary force. To demonstrate such finite reservoir effect, the reservoir is placed vertically above the microchannel. Under such condition, the pressure field expression at the rectangular microchannel inlet is deduced. Appropriate correlations for effective physical properties are used to account for the presence of microbeads in the working fluid, mimicking biomolecules in actual LOC. The non-dimensional governing equation for capillary flow with finite size reservoir is derived based on the balance among the surface, viscous and gravity forces acting on the fluid front. The numerical solution of governing equation is obtained to investigate the impact of several operating parameters on the flow front progression. It is observed that the aspect ratio of the microchannel and reservoir play vital roles in deciding the behavior and magnitude of flow front progression in the microfluidic channels. Capillarity and gravity force dominant regions during the progression is observed. The microchannel width and reservoir width decide the interplay between gravity and capillarity. Although higher fluid level in the reservoir has an added advantage for more gravitational head, the resistance from the reservoir makes the flow front progress slowly at the beginning of the capillary transport. It is also found that microbead volume fraction in the working fluid plays an important role in delaying the capillary transport under various operating conditions. Hence, it can be concluded that the use of reservoir at the inlet of microfluidic channels has an impact on the overall capillary transport of biomolecules in LOC devices.}

The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index. Examples of application of the procedure are included.}

Recently, a new failure mode of TBCs caused by calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) glass has attracted increasing attention. In this paper, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBCs produced by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) were exposed to CMAS deposits at 1250°C. The microstructure evolution and failure mechanism of the coatings were investigated. It has been shown that CMAS glass penetrated into the YSZ ceramic layer along the inter-columnar gaps and interacted with YSZ. As a result, an interaction zone of about 20μm thickness, which was the mixture of CMAS and YSZ with equiaxial structure, was formed in the YSZ surface layer after 4h heat-treatment at 1250°C. Meanwhile, yttria in YSZ layer as a stabilizer was dissolved in CMAS glass and caused accelerated monoclinic phase transformation. After 8h heat-treatment, degradation of YSZ TBC occurred by delamination cracking of YSZ layer, which is quite different from the traditional failure caused by interfacial cracking at the YSZ/metallic bond coat. Physical models have been built to describe the failure mechanism of EB-PVD TBCs attacked by CMAS deposits.},

   abstract = {Over the last decade a significant amount of research has been conducted into the durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) focusing mainly on issues of oxidation, erosion and foreign object damage (FOD). However, as the performance and durability of TBCs has improved the temperatures at which they operate has increased. This increase in temperature has resulted in another lifing issue for EB PVD TBCs, namely that of CMAS attack. Calcium–magnesium–alumino-silicate (CMAS) attack occurs when atmospheric dust that has deposited on the surface of turbine blades melts and wicks into the columns of the TBC. This occurs at temperatures above 1240–1260°C and results in the degradation of the columnar microstructure of the TBCs. Due to the fact that TBCs operate in a temperature gradient CMAS only infiltrates part of the coating before solidifying. There are a number of issues associated with CMAS attack, both chemical and mechanical. From a chemical point of view CMAS attack of electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposited (PVD) TBCs can be considered as a form of corrosion; when there is a lot of excess CMAS on the surface of a coated component Yttria diffuses out of the TBC into the molten CMAS resulting in a t′ to monoclinic phase transformation in the yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ), CMAS attack also results in localised melting and subsequent re-precipitation of the coating resulting in a loss of the defined columnar microstructure. While from a mechanical point of view the CMAS, once re-solidified, reduces the strain compliance of the EB PVD and can result in spallation of the TBC on cooling. Furthermore, current studies have indicated that small amount of CMAS infiltration significantly increases the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs. This paper covers various aspects of CMAS attack of EB PVD TBCs, specifically looking at minimum levels of CMAS required to initiate damage, as well as investigating it from an erosion–corrosion perspective.},

We also report the enthalpy of mixing between the coatings and molten silicate after combining the results measured by high-temperature solution calorimetry with enthalpies of fusion measured by drop-and-catch calorimetry and differential thermal analysis. The enthalpies of solution of selected silicate and zirconia-based coatings and apatite reaction products are moderately positive except for 7YSZ, yttria-stabilized zirconia. Apatite formation is only favorable over coating dissolution in terms of enthalpy for 7YSZ. The enthalpies of mixing between the coatings and the molten silicate are less exothermic for Yb2Si2O7 and CaYb4Si3O13 than for 7YSZ, indicating lower energetic stability of the latter against molten silicate corrosion. The thermochemical results explain and support the very corrosive nature of CMAS melts in contact with ceramic coatings.},

CMAS infiltrates into TBC at high temperatures and stiffens the TBC which ultimately loses its strain tolerance and gets delaminated. The EB-PVD technique is used to coat TBCs exhibiting a columnar microstructure on parts such as blades and on vanes. By varying the EB-PVD process parameters, columnar morphology and porosity of the 7YSZ coating is changed and its effect on the CMAS infiltration behaviour is studied in detail. Two different TBC pore geometries were created and infiltration experiments were carried out at 1250°C and 1225°C for different time intervals. The 7YSZ coating with more ‘feathery’ features has resulted in higher CMAS resistance by at least by a factor of 2 than its less ‘feathery’ counterpart.

CMAS ingestion process can erode compressor blades, erode/infiltration thermal barrier coatings, and lead to overheating and stall. To better understand the physical details, this paper presents a novel approach to exploring individual CMAS dynamics in the context of melting particles. The methodology was accomplished by resolving the details of a single CMAS particle using the volume-of-fluid method. To account for thermal properties of the flow and particle, melting-solidification modeling was implemented. The particle was initialized at a stagnant condition with a temperature under its solidus temperature. The flow around the particle was initialized at turbine relevant conditions, including high velocities and temperatures above the particle’s liquidus temperature. Transient conditions were explored in context of non-dimensional numbers (including slip Reynold’s Number, Weber number, and Ohnesorge number), as well as several ratios (ρs/ρg and Ts/T∞). For validation, sensitivity to mesh and input, as well as experimental comparisons were examined. The experimental comparison benchmarked the temperature ratio of particles at varying thermal Stokes numbers against the experimental correlation shown in Bojdo et al. [1].},

abstract = {The strain tolerance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in gas turbine engines is enhanced by incorporation of through-thickness pores within the coating. However, molten calcium–magnesium–alumino–silicate (CMAS) deposits are then able to permeate through the interconnected pore network resulting in dissolution of the coating in the silicate melt, precipitation of new phases, and the elimination of the pores needed for strain tolerance when silicate melt solidification occurs upon cooling. Here we used an electron beam directed vapor deposition method to deposit strain tolerant coatings containing a high volume fraction of inter-columnar pores to assess the effect of increasing the pore volume fraction upon silicate melt infiltration in a 7wt.% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC. We then explore two potential mitigation approaches. One investigated the infiltration of a samarium zirconate (SZO) coating deposited on a 7wt.% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) buffer layer since recent work has indicated the related gadolinium zirconate (GZO) system was much more CMAS resistant than 7YSZ. The second explored the effects of an embedded platinum layer located near the outer surface of the SZO layer. The response of both systems to attack by a model 33CaO–9MgO–13AlO1.5–45SiO2 CMAS melt at 1250°C has been compared to that of the 7YSZ composition coating deposited by the same process. The 7YSZ specimens were fully infiltrated by CMAS in less than 1min and significantly dissolved and re-precipitated a globular phase after 4h of exposure. The penetration rate in SZO coatings was reduced by about a factor of five, but the coatings were still completely penetrated after a 4hour exposure. Significant SZO dissolution and precipitation of both globular fluorite and faceted apatite phases were observed after the 4h of exposure, with concomitant debonding at the SZO/YSZ interface. The insertion of a 5μm thick Pt layer about 30μm below the SZO surface arrested permeation of CMAS for about 16h and might provide a promising strategy for controlling CMAS degradation in TBCs without reducing the thermo-cyclic delamination resistance.}

   abstract = {Two standard 7YSZ coatings were deposited by EB-PVD techniques and tested against CMAS infiltration at short time intervals (up to 8 min.) at 1250 °C in air. They exhibited different microstructures, i.e. porosities and microstructural features. Two species of CMAS with different compositions were used and their viscosities were determined using the concentric cylinder method and their contact angles were measured using high temperature heating microscopy. The theoretical viscosities, which were calculated using a statistical model based on the chemical composition of the melts, differed from the measured values of the viscosities by one order of magnitude. A large variation in the contact angles within a very short range of temperature (1243–1266 °C) was observed as well. The porosity and surface area measurements were performed on both EB-PVD microstructures using the nitrogen physisorption method. Additionally, the produced coatings exhibited porosities of 14.5 and 29.5 percent and the infiltration experiments have shown that the more porous coating provides higher infiltration resistance. The effect of porosity on CMAS infiltration kinetics was investigated and the results elucidate that the porosity network plays a more preeminent role than the amount of porosity. The experimental infiltration results have been compared with calculated infiltration data using a novel mathematical approach proposed in previous studies in which the permeability of the coatings is assessed with two contrasting methods termed “concentric pipe” and “open pipe” models. The infiltration was calculated by incorporating the experimentally determined properties such as contact angle, viscosity and porosity. A fitting parameter has been derived from the equations for the geometry factor for both microstructures. The calculated and experimental results are in good agreement with the concentric pipe model supporting the validity of this CMAS infiltration model.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which the durability and functionality of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are compromised by the infiltration of molten calcium–magnesium alumino-silicates (CMAS) requires an assessment of the effects on the thermal and mechanical properties of the coating. This study focuses on quantifying the effect of CMAS on the thermal properties and heat transport in TBCs. The thermal properties of a 7wt.\% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC deposited on a superalloy substrate by air plasma spray (APS) were measured before and after CMAS infiltration. A rise in both volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coating was observed upon infiltration. Calculations to explain these trends were performed for a model TBC system and found to be in good agreement with the measured results. The evolution of the phase constitution of the coating was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and the integrity of the interface was characterized by optical examination of cross sections. These tests determined that the coating remained in good contact with the substrate and experienced no phase change after infiltration.}

A batch of as-received desert sand was melted into calcium magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) glass at ~1500°C. From inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, chemical composition of the CMAS glass was analyzed to be 27.8CaO-4MgO-5Al2O3-61.6SiO2-0.6Fe2O3-1K2O (mole \%). Various physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the glass have been evaluated. Bulk density of CMAS glass was 2.69g/cm3, Young׳s modulus 92GPa, Shear modulus 36GPa, Poisson׳s ratio 0.28, dilatometric glass transition temperature (Tg) 706°C, softening point (Td) 764°C, Vickers microhardness 6.3±0.4GPa, indentation fracture toughness 0.75±0.15MPa.m1/2, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) 9.8×10−6/°C in the temperature range 25 to 700°C. Temperature dependence of viscosity has also been estimated from various reference points of the CMAS glass using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation as well as from the glass composition. The glass remained amorphous after heat treating at 850°C for 10h but crystallized into CaSiO3 and Ca2Mg0.5AlSi1.5O7 phases at 900°C or higher temperatures. Crystallization kinetics of the CMAS glass has also been investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA).}

We describe the evolution in the thermal properties of a 7 wt.\% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 electron beam-physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coating with thermal cycling between room temperature and 1150°C until failure. The thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the coating were evaluated non-destructively based on the analysis of its photothermal infrared emission. Although the coating density does not increase significantly with thermal cycling, the thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the coating increased substantially, particularly during the first 20 1h cycles. The values then approach a limiting value. Complementary Raman spectroscopy suggests that the increase is accompanied by a reduction in the defect concentration in the coating and that there is also a correlation between the width of the Raman lines and the thermal conductivity.}

Hence, there is a critical need to understand the governing mechanisms to inform the development of durable thermal and environmental barrier coatings. The objective of the current work is to present a novel multiscale physics-based approach to study two-phase flows that take into account the underpinning particle transport and deposition dynamics. Sessile droplet models are presented and used to compute the contact angle at high temperatures and compared with experiments. The study also investigates the sensitivity of deposition patterns to the Stokes number and the results identify local vulnerability regions. The analysis suggests that particle size distributions and the initial trajectories of the particles are critically important in predicting the final deposition pattern.},

   abstract = {The viscosity of silicate melts controls magma transport dynamics, eruption style and rates of physicochemical processes (e.g., degassing, crystallization) in natural magmas. Thus a comprehensive viscosity model for magmatic liquids has long been a goal of earth scientists. Here we present a model that predicts the non-Arrhenian Newtonian viscosity of silicate melts as a function of T and melt composition, including the rheologically important volatile constituents H2O and F. Our model is based on >1770 measurements of viscosity on multicomponent anhydrous and volatile-rich silicate melts. The non-Arrhenian T-dependence of viscosity is accounted for by the VFT equation [log η=A+B/(T(K)−C)]. The optimization assumes a common, high-T limit (A) for silicate melt viscosity and returns a value for this limit of −4.55 (+0.2) (e.g., log η~10−4.6 Pa s). All compositional dependence is ascribed to the parameters B and C and is accounted for by an additional 17 model coefficients. Our model is continuous in composition- and temperature-space and predicts the viscosity of natural volatile-bearing silicate melts (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, FeOtot, CaO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, H2O, F2O−1) over fifteen log units of viscosity (10−1–1014 Pa s). The model for viscosity can also predict other transport properties including glass transition temperatures (Tg) and melt fragility (m). We show strong systematic decreases in Tg and m with increasing volatile content. This pattern has implications for predicting styles of volcanic eruption and understanding silicate melt structure. Our model transforms a quarter-century of experimental study of melt viscosities, into a parameterisation having a predictive capacity that makes it relevant to diverse fields of research including: volcanology, geophysics, petrology and material sciences.},

   abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2023-0179.vidSand and volcanic ash may be ingested into an aircraft engine during operation in regions where these materials are abundant. These calcium-magnesium-aluminosilicate (CMAS) compositions infiltrate into high temperature electron-beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) ceramic thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). CMAS interacts both thermochemically and thermomechanically with the ceramic coating. Of the possible phases that originate from transformations that take place during the interaction, the monoclinic phase is associated with a volumetric expansion, introducing additional stresses to the coating system and promoting micro-crack initiation. It is therefore vital to elucidate the complementary nature between the thermochemical and thermomechanical mechanisms influencing the residual stress for better coating and CMAS-related degradation monitoring. This work compares results and draws connections from outcomes of previous efforts using 3D confocal Raman spectroscopy to non-destructively evaluate localized, microscale, coating degradation of standard EB-PVD 7YSZ TBCs due to CMAS attack. Preliminary CFD simulations also provide the opportunity to evaluate microstructural effects on CMAS infiltration and infiltration rate. The larger picture of coating degradation monitoring is used to suggest mitigation strategies to prevent premature coating failure with a future outlook toward CFD simulation studies. The ability to non-destructively capture this degradation and represent the associated probed volume will lead towards better damage monitoring as well as aid in the development and implementation of more CMAS-resistant coatings and additional mitigation strategies.},
